## Here are two functions to cache a matrix and cache the 
## result for further calculations

## makeCacheMatrix 
## Calculate the reverse of a (squared) matrix
## Create a cached version of the reversed matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## cacheSolve
## If a cached version of the reversed matrix exists
## the cached version is returned. Otherwise the 
## reversed matrix is calculated and returned.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
